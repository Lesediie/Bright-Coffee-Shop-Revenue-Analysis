✅ Recommendations to Improve Performance

- Investigate causes for underperformance (e.g., foot traffic, customer service, competition) and implement location-specific improvements.
  
  Expand Product Variety in High-Demand Categories
  
- Introduce more flavored coffees or teas, seasonal drinks, or healthy options based on customer trends.
  
  Use Data to Inform Inventory and Marketing
  
- Align stock levels and promotions with best-selling products and peak times to reduce waste and increase efficiency.
- Enhance Customer Experience
- collect feedback regularly and improve ambiance, speed of service, or store layout based on customer insights.
